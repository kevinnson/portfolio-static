                    Here are a few projects I've done through my undergrad.
                    They were done in a group of 3-4 students as a class project
                    to present at the end of the quarter. Manuals and documentation
                    were written for the application as welll. Clicking on the
                    image will route to the GitHub repository.

                    <p>
                        ThinkFast is a collection of brain-games that are thrown
                        at increasing speeds, all while on a timer. As the player
                        completes puzzles, the timer is extended, but the
                        difficulty also increases. The application consists of
                        three minigames: CallOut, TouchMaze, and ShakeQ.
                        <br> <br>
                        CallOut presents a word with some letters blanked out,
                        so the player has to call out their guesses for what the
                        word is. A category is provided as a hint.
                        <br> <br>
                        TouchMaze creates a randomly generated maze where the
                        player has to complete it using the phone's touchscreen
                        interface without lifting their finger.
                        <br> <br>
                        ShakeQ presents a series of randomized math expressions
                        requiring the user to response to the criteria with the
                        correct math expression by shaking the device.

                    <p>
                        SpeedChess is a multiplayer game of chess, with some rules
                        changed to make the game fast-paced with players having to
                        utilize their predictive intuitions. Rather than
                        alternating turns, players take turns and choose moves
                        simultaneously, adding hidden information to the system
                        of chess and requiring players to think a couple steps
                        ahead to their opponents throughout the game.
