                    Hello! My name is Kevin Son, and I am studying computer science
                    at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I currently
                    don't have a picture of myself, but here's a picture of a
                    white german shepherd which is my favorite dog breed. Besides
                    having an interest in software engineering and data analysis,
                    I also enjoy using a subset of Adobe Products to dabble in
                    photography, video editting, and graphic designing on my
                    free time.
